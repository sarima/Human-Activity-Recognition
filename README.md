Human-Activity-Recognition
==========================

To build a tidy dataset based on data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, you need to run the "run_analysis.R" script.

The following data files need to be in your workspace:
* features.txt
* activity_labels.txt

The following data files need to be in a "train" directory in your workspace:
* subject_train.txt
* X_train.txt
* y_train.txt

Tha same applies for subject\_test.txt, X\_test.txt and y\_test.txt which should be in a "test"
directory.

"run\_analysis.R"" will generate a tidy dataset called "tidy\_dataset.txt" in your workspace.

See "CodeBook.md" for further details on variables descriptions.
